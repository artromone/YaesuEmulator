In collaboration with my mentor, I developed an emulator for a Japanese controller. This emulator processes commands and controls the antenna rotation. The project used a Qt framework with a user interface built using QML. The design architecture followed the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, with signal-slot bindings used for intercomponent communication. The development took place on Ubuntu 22.04.
